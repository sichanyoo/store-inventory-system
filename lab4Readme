BY SUBMITTING THIS FILE TO CARMEN, I CERTIFY THAT I HAVE STRICTLY ADHERED TO THE
TENURES OF THE OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY'S ACADEMIC INTEGRITY POLICY WITH RESPECT TO THIS ASSIGNMENT.
THIS IS THE README FILE FOR LAB 4.
NAME: SICHAN YUH

Total amount of time took:
- Around 20 hours.

Comments in general about the lab contents:
- Doing this lab took a long time and lots of effort.
  However I think I learned a lot as well.
  Manipulating Node structs to form a singly linked list and building UI capabilities was fun.
  I hope I do well on this lab.

How gdb was used:
- Valgrind was telling me there are memory leaks.
  So I repeated the exactly same input with gdb, looking through line by line in program execution
  and stepping into methods upon call from main function.
  I set breakpoints whereever I dynamically allocated memory for a Node, by going through the program,
  stepping into methods, and writing the command "break malloc".
  Then using this focused look at malloc calls using gdb, I realized that I don't free the node memory
  when the user tries to add a new grocery item with a stock number that is already in the list.
  gdb was very helpful once again.
